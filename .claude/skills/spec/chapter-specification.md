# Skill: Chapter-Level Specification

## Purpose
Define detailed specifications for individual chapters, establishing clear learning objectives, content structure, and success criteria at the chapter level.

## Responsibility
Create granular chapter specifications that guide content creation, ensure pedagogical soundness, and maintain consistency with book-level goals.

## When to Use
- Planning a new chapter
- Breaking down book-level specs into actionable units
- Defining section-by-section learning flow
- Establishing chapter-specific assessment criteria

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Chapter Scope Definition
- Define chapter title and positioning within the book
- Establish chapter-level learning objectives
- Identify prerequisite knowledge from previous chapters
- Specify estimated reading and practice time
- Define difficulty level and cognitive load

### 2. Section Architecture
- Break chapter into logical sections
- Define learning goal for each section
- Establish narrative flow between sections
- Specify depth of coverage for each topic
- Identify transition points and summaries

### 3. Content Requirements
- Specify required explanations and concepts
- Define code examples and their purpose
- Identify diagrams, visualizations, and media needs
- Establish hands-on exercises and practice problems
- Define real-world application scenarios

### 4. Pedagogical Strategy
- Map theory → intuition → application flow
- Define simplification strategies for complex topics
- Specify analogies and mental models to use
- Establish scaffolding approach for difficult concepts
- Define formative assessment checkpoints

### 5. Integration Points
- Reference related chapters and concepts
- Define cross-references and links
- Establish terminology consistency
- Specify dependencies on external resources
- Define capstone project connections

## Output Format

A chapter specification should include:

```
# Chapter Specification: [Chapter Number] - [Title]

## Overview
- **Chapter Number**: [X]
- **Title**: [Full title]
- **Position**: [Where it fits in the book]
- **Estimated Time**: [Reading + practice time]
- **Difficulty**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]

## Learning Objectives
By completing this chapter, learners will be able to:
1. [Specific, measurable objective 1]
2. [Specific, measurable objective 2]
3. [Specific, measurable objective 3]

## Prerequisites
- [Concept from Chapter X]
- [Skill from Chapter Y]
- [External knowledge Z]

## Section Breakdown

### Section 1: [Title]
- **Learning Goal**: [What this section achieves]
- **Key Concepts**: [Main ideas]
- **Content Type**: [Explanation/Tutorial/Exercise]
- **Estimated Time**: [Minutes]

### Section 2: [Title]
[Repeat structure]

## Content Requirements

### Explanations Needed
- [Concept 1]: [Depth level]
- [Concept 2]: [Depth level]

### Code Examples
- [Example 1]: [Purpose and learning goal]
- [Example 2]: [Purpose and learning goal]

### Visualizations
- [Diagram 1]: [What it should show]
- [Diagram 2]: [What it should show]

### Hands-On Exercises
- [Exercise 1]: [Objective and expected outcome]
- [Exercise 2]: [Objective and expected outcome]

## Pedagogical Approach
- **Mental Model**: [Core analogy or framework]
- **Simplification Strategy**: [How to make complex topics accessible]
- **Scaffolding**: [How to build up to difficult concepts]
- **Assessment**: [How to check understanding]

## Cross-References
- Links to: [Chapter X, Section Y]
- Builds on: [Previous concepts]
- Prepares for: [Future chapters]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Learner can [specific action 1]
- [ ] Learner can [specific action 2]
- [ ] Learner can [specific action 3]

## Notes
[Any additional context, constraints, or considerations]
```

## Quality Standards
- Learning objectives must be specific and measurable
- Section flow must follow logical progression
- Content requirements must be actionable
- Pedagogical strategy must be explicit
- Success criteria must be testable

## Integration Points
- Derives from book-level specification
- Guides content authoring process
- Informs UI/UX section design
- Establishes assessment checkpoints
- Feeds into capstone project design
