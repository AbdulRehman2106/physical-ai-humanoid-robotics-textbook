# Skill: Book-Level Specification

## Purpose
Define comprehensive specifications for technical books and courses, establishing clear structure, learning goals, and success criteria.

## Responsibility
Create detailed book-level specifications that serve as the authoritative source of truth for content creation, ensuring alignment across all chapters and modules.

## When to Use
- Starting a new book or course project
- Defining the scope and boundaries of educational content
- Establishing learning outcomes and progression
- Creating a roadmap for multi-chapter technical books

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Book Structure Definition
- Define book title, subtitle, and positioning
- Establish target audience and prerequisites
- Outline chapter hierarchy and module organization
- Specify estimated reading time and difficulty progression
- Define book-level learning outcomes

### 2. Learning Architecture
- Map conceptual dependencies between chapters
- Design learning progression (beginner → intermediate → advanced)
- Identify prerequisite knowledge for each section
- Define cognitive load distribution across chapters
- Establish narrative arc and thematic connections

### 3. Success Criteria
- Define measurable learning outcomes
- Specify what learners should be able to do after each chapter
- Establish assessment criteria for knowledge retention
- Define practical application benchmarks
- Create evaluation rubrics for capstone projects

### 4. Scope Management
- Clearly define what is IN scope
- Explicitly state what is OUT of scope
- Identify external dependencies (tools, platforms, prior knowledge)
- Define boundaries with related topics
- Establish content depth guidelines

### 5. Consistency Framework
- Define terminology standards and glossary
- Establish code style and example conventions
- Specify visual and formatting standards
- Define admonition usage patterns (notes, warnings, tips)
- Create cross-reference conventions

## Output Format

A book specification should include:

```
# Book Specification: [Title]

## Overview
- **Title**: [Full title]
- **Subtitle**: [Descriptive subtitle]
- **Target Audience**: [Who this is for]
- **Prerequisites**: [Required knowledge]
- **Estimated Duration**: [Reading/completion time]

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this book, learners will be able to:
1. [Outcome 1]
2. [Outcome 2]
3. [Outcome 3]

## Chapter Structure
### Chapter 1: [Title]
- **Learning Goals**: [What learners will achieve]
- **Key Concepts**: [Main topics covered]
- **Prerequisites**: [Required prior knowledge]
- **Estimated Time**: [Reading time]

[Repeat for all chapters]

## Conceptual Dependencies
[Diagram or list showing how chapters build on each other]

## Scope
### In Scope
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]

### Out of Scope
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]

## Success Criteria
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

## Terminology Standards
- [Term 1]: [Definition]
- [Term 2]: [Definition]

## Assessment Strategy
[How learning will be evaluated]
```

## Quality Standards
- Specifications must be unambiguous and actionable
- Learning outcomes must be measurable and observable
- Chapter progression must follow logical cognitive flow
- Scope boundaries must be explicit and justified
- All terminology must be consistently defined

## Integration Points
- Feeds into chapter-level specifications
- Informs content authoring guidelines
- Guides UI/UX design decisions
- Establishes assessment criteria
- Defines capstone project requirements
