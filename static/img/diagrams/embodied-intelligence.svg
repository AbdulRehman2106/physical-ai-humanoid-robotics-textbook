<!-- Embodied Intelligence Illustration

     This illustration should visualize the concept of embodied intelligence showing:

     1. Central Figure:
        - Simplified robot or agent silhouette
        - Highlight the body as integral to intelligence (not just a vessel)

     2. Sensory Systems:
        - Visual perception (cameras/eyes)
        - Proprioception (joint sensors, body awareness)
        - Tactile sensing (touch, force feedback)
        - Show these as active, bidirectional connections

     3. Environment Interaction:
        - Objects in the environment
        - Arrows showing action-perception loops
        - Demonstrate how body shape constrains and enables actions

     4. Key Concepts Annotated:
        - "Intelligence emerges from interaction"
        - "Body shapes cognition"
        - "No internal world model needed"
        - "Morphological computation"

     5. Visual Metaphor:
        - Consider showing contrast between:
          * Traditional AI: brain in a box with inputs/outputs
          * Embodied AI: integrated body-mind-environment system

     Visual Style:
        - Illustrative, not photorealistic
        - Use flowing lines to show continuous interaction
        - Color palette: purples and teals for a modern, tech feel
        - Include subtle motion indicators (dotted lines, arrows)

  <desc id="embodied-intelligence-desc">Illustration showing how intelligence emerges from the interaction between a robot's body, its sensors, and the environment. Arrows indicate continuous sensor-motor loops where perception and action are tightly coupled, demonstrating that the body itself is integral to intelligence rather than just a vessel for computation.</desc>
