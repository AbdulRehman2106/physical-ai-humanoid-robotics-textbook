<!-- Communication Patterns Comparison Diagram

     This diagram should compare the three main ROS 2 communication patterns:

     1. Three-Column Layout:

        **Column 1: Topics (Pub-Sub)**
        - Icon: Multiple nodes connected to a central topic
        - Characteristics:
          * Many-to-many
          * Asynchronous
          * Continuous data
          * Fire-and-forget
        - Use cases: Sensor data, state updates
        - Example: Camera → /image → [Detector, Recorder, Viewer]

        **Column 2: Services (Request-Response)**
        - Icon: Client and server with bidirectional arrow
        - Characteristics:
          * One-to-one
          * Synchronous
          * Occasional operations
          * Waits for response
        - Use cases: Queries, computations
        - Example: Client → "Compute path" → Server → Path result

        **Column 3: Actions (Goal-Based)**
        - Icon: Client, server, with feedback loop
        - Characteristics:
          * One-to-one
          * Asynchronous with feedback
          * Long-running tasks
          * Cancellable
        - Use cases: Navigation, manipulation
        - Example: Client → Goal → Server → [Feedback...] → Result

     2. Decision Tree (bottom):
        - "Need response?" → No: Topic, Yes: Continue
        - "Takes >1 second?" → No: Service, Yes: Action
        - "Need progress updates?" → No: Service, Yes: Action

     3. Visual Style:
        - Clean comparison layout
        - Color code: Green (Topics), Blue (Services), Orange (Actions)
        - Icons for each pattern
        - Clear labels and examples
